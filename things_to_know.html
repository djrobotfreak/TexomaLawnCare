            <h4>Trees and Fences</h4>
            <p>In order to make your yard look its best we use a line trimmer (weedeater). If you are concerned about string damage please put protection around your trees or fences. String damage is more likely to occur when beds don't have any edging around them, or plants are planted in the yard without protection around the base. With that said, we do our best not to damage anything. </p>

            <h4>Blowing</h4>
            <p>After the mowing, edging, and trimming is completed, we will blow the grass clippings off of the sidewalks, porch, and anywhere else there shouldn’t be grass. We will also go through the grass and break up any spots where the clippings have “pooled”. </p>

            <h4>Bi-weekly Service Warning</h4>
            <p>We highly discourage Bi-weekly service. There will be many times during the year, especially during the summer months, that grass will grow too quickly to wait two weeks between cuttings. We will provide service on a bi-weekly basis if necessary, but we don’t recommend it. </p>
