        <h2>Trees and Fences</h2>
        <p>In order to make your yard look its best we use a line trimmer (weedeater). If you are concerned about string damage please put protection around your trees or fences. String damage is more likely to occur when beds don't have any edging around them, or plants are planted in the yard without protection around the base. With that said, we do our best not to damage anything. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Blowing</h2>
        <p>After the mowing, edging, and trimming is completed, we will blow the grass clippings off of the sidewalks, porch, and anywhere else there shouldn’t be grass. We will also go through the grass and break up any spots where the clippings have “pooled”. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Bi-weekly Service Warning</h2>
        <p>We highly discourage Bi-weekly service. There will be many times during the year, especially during the summer months, that grass will grow too quickly to wait two weeks between cuttings. We will provide service on a bi-weekly basis if necessary, but we don’t recommend it. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Scheduling</h2>
        <p>We will work with you and set a day of the week that we will consistently mow your yard on. Unless we contact you ahead of time and weather permitting, we will service your yard on your scheduled day. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Rain Delays</h2>
        <p>If we can effectively mow your yard in the rain, we will. In the event that the weather is too bad, we will contact you and will be out as soon as possible to mow. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Gates and Pets</h2>
        <p>On your scheduled day, please leave your gates unlocked or give us access to combinations and or keys to the locks. We take special care to make sure gates stay closed when possible, but we cannot assume responsibility for escaped pets. Please be sure your pets are inside or secured by a leash on the day that we come. </p>
